# Data Structures reference.

About:
	i took my first data structure course at the age of 18.
	by learning data structures gave me a deeper understanding
	about the overall programming concepts, algorithms,and 
	so many advanced features i never used.
	And also data structure allow me to develope my skills
	into a higher level.

What i learned:
		
	I learned about different types of data structure,algorithms
	stacks , queues, linked lists.
	
	I learned to use my theoritical knowleadge in practical 
	real world problems and it allowed me to solve the fast
	and easier.
