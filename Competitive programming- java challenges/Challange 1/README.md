# Competitive programming java challenges

Challenge 1:

Question:
	
	There was a teacher in a small town who loves coding and he wants to create a program which
	prints out the whole multipication table of an entered number for his students.
	Can you help him to write a program in java?

Comment:
	
	This one was very easy to me, so i this a little bit harder by adding new features like setting
	limit of table, and also return multiplication table and other arithmetic tables
