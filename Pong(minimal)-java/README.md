# Java pong game with jframe and jpanel

 This is an simple java pong game with minimal features


USAGE:


       I created this game based of the simple classic pong game, and the reason for creating 
       this game was my friends on my collage. they were just sarting to learn java for the first
       time so i thought that i could share this simple game so they can learn it more fastly.


WHAT I LEARNED:


       1. By developing this game i understood that making stuffs for others make me more happy
	  instead of my own self salvation.
