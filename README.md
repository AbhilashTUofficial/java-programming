# java-programming
I learned java when I'm 18 years old. I was truly amazed by its power and speed. After learning c++ I learned python, but I don't like python too much because of it's less speed and less complexity, yeah it's odd I like more complexity rather than easy once because it's forced me to hit my limit. It was the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, I requested one of my collage computer science teacher to give me a project, and she told me to build an app, it was that magical moment. I forced myself to learn java. In the beginning, it was hard for me, to learn a completely complex new language, but I eventually fall in love with java. and now I like java more than any language.
