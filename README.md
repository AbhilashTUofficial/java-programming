# Early days with java
<<<<<<< HEAD
  
I learned java when i'm 18 years old. I was truly amazed by it's power and speed. After my learning c++ i learned 
python, but i don't like python too much because of it's less speed and less complexity, yeah it's odd i like more 
complexity rather than easy once because it's force me to hit my limit. 
It was the time of COVID-19 pandemic, i requested to once of my collage computer science teacher to give me a project, and she told me to build an app, it was that magical momment. I forced my self to learn java. At the beginning it was hard to me, to learn an completly complex new language, but i eventually fall in love with java.
and now i like java more than any language.


Why java is my favourite?
	
	1. I like java because, in java importing new modules(packages and class) is so
	easy. In other languages like python i had an hard time installing new packages,
	because of the poor networking and a lot of technical proplems

	2. java forced me to learn everything deeply

	3. I like java because it is platform independent and fast
